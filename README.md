tasktime
========

*tasktime* reads information of a project from [taskwarrior](http://www.taskwarrior.org) and calculates, how much time was spent with this project.
*tasktime* can print CSV or readable output.

Usage
-----

    ./tasktime.py [parameters...] <project>

### Parameters

    -h, --help              Show help message
    -c, --csv               Print output in CSV format
    -n, --null              Print also tasks without time information (default: no)
    -t, --task [cmd]        Change task command

Prepare taskwarrior
-------------------

You have to update the `tasklib` python package to the version that has the
`get_history` method.

Note time with taskwarrior
--------------------------

taskwarrior has the operations *start* and *stop*.
This information is used to calculate the spent time.
You have to start and stop the tasks you work on.

Example:

    task 2 start

    # Work on task 2...

    task 2 stop

Examples
--------

        Duration: 00:13:05
    Do something really cool
        Duration: 02:18:35

    Sum: 02:31:40
